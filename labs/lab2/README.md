# CE888: Data Science and Decision Making
## Lab 2: Resampling Statistics

Brief writeup on Lab 2 and getting stuck in with some of Python's Data Science toolkits.

### Setting Up

* *Did not* set up an Overleaf account as I'm familiar with LaTex and have tools to work with it
* *Did* send email to Ana with my GitHub username
* *Did* download the slides and initial code, and upload to GitHub
* *Did* download PyCharm, but seem unlikely to use it as I have tools I prefer

### Data Visualisation

Here I was pleased to be able to create a working `vehicles.py` and generate the scatter plot and histogram. This was admittedly mainly a case of copying and trimming the `salaries.py` code, but I made sure to take the time to understand it.
